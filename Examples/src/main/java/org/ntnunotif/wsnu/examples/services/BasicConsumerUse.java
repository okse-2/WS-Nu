        // First you need an instance of the NotificationConsumer class. This will be the class you interact with to
        // register with producers/ brokers, and where you tell your program where to send the notify messages.
        NotificationConsumer notificationConsumer = new NotificationConsumer();

        // To get it up and able to receive Notify messages, it needs to be registered with a hub that can direct it
        // onto the Internet. The simplest way of doing this would be to run the quickBuild command. The returned hub is
        // there to enable multiple Web Services on one hub.
        SoapForwardingHub hub = notificationConsumer.quickBuild(endpoint);

        // Well, at this point, the consumer can receive notifies. But nothing happens to them. To change this, we need

        // Well this is all well. But we still do not receive any notifies. The reason behind this is of course that no
        // producers knows we exists, and therefore do not know that we wish to receive any messages.

        // To fix this, we need to know where a producer is located, its complete address.
        // Let us just assume it is located here:
        String producerAddress = "http://localhost:8080/exampleProducer";
